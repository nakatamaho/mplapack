 Tests of the Multiple precision version of LAPACK MPLAPACK VERSION 2.0.0
 Based on the original LAPACK VERSION 3.9.1

The following parameter values will be used:
        M  :     0     1     2     3     5    10    50
        N  :     0     1     2     3     5    10    50
     NRHS  :     1     2    15
       NB  :     1     3     3     3    20
       NX  :     1     0     5     9     1
     RANK  :    30    50    90

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   60.00

 Relative machine underflow is taken to be : +1.7019382623481672e-1388255822130839283
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be : +5.8756537891115876e+1388255822130839282
 Relative machine precision is taken to be : +7.4583407312002067e-155
